# Overview
OBS-FACE is a script for Filtering, Annotating, Consolidating and Exporting OpenBikeSensor measurements stored in CSV-format.

## Filtering
Measurements with invalid time stamp, location or distance measurement are filtered out. Further, only confirmed measurements are kept.

In addition, usernames are replaced by pseudonyms, and only selected information are kept before exporting for visualization.

## Annotation
Each measurement is assigned to one _way_ as described by the OpenStreetMap data. GPS positions are corrected by 
projecting it in to the way. Further, for each *confirmed* measurement, information from OpenStreetMap such as street name are duplicated to the measurement.

## Consolidating
All confirmed and valid measurements are collected and consolidated in one file in Json format.

## Export
The consolidated measurements are converted to GeoJson format and exported for visualization.


# Installation
Clone code

`git clone https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensor-Scripts/OBS-FACE/tree/main/`

## Requirements
The code is tested with Python 3.8.

Install required packages:

`python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt `

# Usage

## Basic Usage
The default data directory is assumed to be

`./data/`

Place all CSV files in subdirectories of `./data/input`: 

`./data/input/User1/`

`./data/input/User2/`

`./data/input/User3/`

etc. 

To annotate, collect and export GeoJson visualization data, run:

`python3.8 obs-face.py -ACV -D "Stuttgart" ` 

For measurement annotation, OpenStreetMap geographic data from district "Stuttgart" is used. Additional districts (Kreise) can be added in this way.

For each CSV-file in `./data/input`, one Json-file with annotated measurements as well as a log file is created in `./data/annotated`.

The consolidated, i.e. valid and confirmed measurements are collected in Json-format in

`./data/collected/measurements.json`

The data exported for visualization will be located in:

`./data/visualization/measurements.json` contain confirmed, valid measurements in GeoJson format.

`./data/visualization/roads.json` contain confirmed, valid measurements consolidated to road segments in GeoJson format.

## Advanced Use
### Add More Districts

`python3.8 obs-face.py -ACV -D "Stuttgart" -D "Pforzheim" -D "Enzkreis" -D "Landkreis BÃ¶blingen" -D "Landkreis Ludwigsburg" -D "Rems-Murr-Kreis" -D "Landkreis Esslingen"`

Make sure the spelling is correct.

### Change Data base Directory
In case your data is located in a different directory, use:
`python3.8 obs-face.py -ACV -D "Stuttgart" -b ./data_collection/Stuttgart/` 

In general the default data structure is as following:

`BASEDIRECTORY/input/` input CSV files to be processed

`BASEDIRECTORY/annotated/` annotated measurements

`BASEDIRECTORY/collected/measurements.json` annotated, filtered and collected measurements

`BASEDIRECTORY/visualization/measurements.json` confirmed, valid measurements in GeoJson format 

`BASEDIRECTORY/visualization/roads.json` confirmed, valid measurements consolidated to road segments in GeoJson format

The base directory is changed by the `-b BASEDIRECTORY` option. The paths can be further customized, see the full option list.

### Exclude Input Files
To exclude subdirectories of the input, use:

`python3.8 obs-face.py -ACV -D "Stuttgart" -e User3/` 

All files in`./data/input/User3/` and subdirectories will be excluded.

The exclusion path `User3/` is considered relative to the input directory path.

### Use Parallel Processing
Some of the time consuming computations can be parallelized. Use

`python3.8 obs-face.py -ACV -D "Stuttgart" -p 4`

to use 4 worker processes. Note that this also increases the memory consumption significantly.
